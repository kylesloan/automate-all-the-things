# automate-all-the-things
Learn some golang and GCP (google cloud compute)


## Problem Statement

Build an application in the programming language of your choice that exposes a REST endpoint that returns the following JSON payload with the current timestamp and a static message:
```
{
  "message": "Automate all the things!",
  "timestamp": 1529729125
}
```
The application must be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster running in a public cloud provider of your choice. The provisioning of the cluster as well as the deployment of the application must be done through code.
