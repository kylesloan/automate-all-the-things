# automate-all-the-things

Learn some golang and GCP (google cloud compute). https://github.com/kylesloan/automate-all-the-things


## Problem Statement

Build an application in the programming language of your choice that exposes a REST endpoint that returns the following JSON payload with the current timestamp and a static message:
```
{
  "message": "Automate all the things!",
  "timestamp": 1529729125
}
```
The application must be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster running in a public cloud provider of your choice. The provisioning of the cluster as well as the deployment of the application must be done through code.


## Steps to get started

* Browser - Login/Create GCP account: https://console.cloud.google.com/
* Browser - Create a project called "automate-all-the-things" (top middle area) and Select Project
* Browser - Navigate to Kubernetes Engine and Enable the API (takes a few minutes): https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes
* Browser - Create a new Service Account under IAM section.  Name is not important, give Owner role, and Create key as JSON.  Move this file to ~/.gcp-serviceaccount.
* CLI - add `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/.gcp-serviceaccount"` to .bash_profile/.zsh_rc and then `source` the file
* CLI - install the cli required tools (on a mac `brew install ansible git terraform golang kubernetes-cli && brew cask install google-cloud-sdk`)
* Browser - Verify you are logged into docker hub: https://hub.docker.com, if not run `docker login` on the command line
* CLI - setup gcloud `gcloud init` and make "automate-all-the-things" the default project
* Browser - Verify that GCP has no more "activity" in the top right and that the K8 cluster is ready.  You should see a bell and not a rotating counter.
* CLI - clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/kylesloan/automate-all-the-things.git`
* Optional - If you used a different name them "automate-all-the-things", please update ansible/vars.yml file.
* CLI - `mage setup` - to create the enviroment, and run tests.  Please note that GCP says it is "done" but it takes several more minutes for the load balancer to really start working.  Commands are given to launch an internal container in the cluster to do tests while you wait.
* CLI - `mage test` - will run a test to hit the cool new service container.  This is also run at the end of `mage setup`
* CLI - `mage destroy` - will shutdown most everything created.  For maximum cleanup, you will want to destroy the project in GCP as well.


## Specific version used while building out this app

* git (2.22.0_1)
* terraform (0.12.5)
* gcloud (google-cloud-sdk) cli tool
* golang (1.12.7)
* kubernetes-cli 1.15.1


### If Mac as work station

If you are using a mac, you can use the following commands to get the prerequisites in place quickly.

tl;dr
```
brew install git terraform golang kubernetes-cli && brew cask install google-cloud-sdk
```

Single commands

* Install home brew: https://brew.sh `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
* Install git via brew `brew install git` or upgrade if already installed `brew upgrade git`
* Install terraform via brew `brew install terraform` or upgrade if already installed `brew upgrade terraform`
* Install gcloud via brew `brew cask install google-cloud-sdk` or upgrade if already installed `brew cask upgrade google-cloud-sdk`

## Common problems

```
Error: googleapi: Error 403: Kubernetes Engine API has not been used in project 184897089599 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/container.googleapis.com/overview?project=184897089599 then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry., accessNotConfigured
```
* Enable billing for the account, and wait a few minutes for it to become active and make the terraform call again
* Ensure you made a service account and not an IAM account for terraform

```
Failed to import the required Python library (openshift) on imac-6.local's Python /usr/local/Cellar/ansible/2.8.3/libexec/bin/python3.7. Please read module documentation and install in the appropriate location

## gcloud debugging commands

This is the CLI you can use to perform commands against GCP endpoints

* `gcloud container clusters list`
* `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-gke-cluster --region us-central1`


## kubectl commands

Some commands to debug and test kube cluster with

* `kubectl config current-context`
* `kubectl run -i --tty ubuntu --image=ubuntu:16.04 --restart=Never -- bash -il` - `apt update && apt install -y curl iputils-ping host`


## Notes taken before all this was automated, you shouldn't need these now

* `git clone https://github.com/kylesloan/automate-all-the-things.git`
* Enable k8 in gcp - https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/container.googleapis.com?
* Login to GCP and go to IAM > Service Accounts and create a terraform user with Owner permissions
* Click Create key at the end of this step and move the it to terraform/account.json file
* `cd $PATH_TO_CHECKOUT/terraform/`
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply` - this took 6 and half minutes
* `cd $PATH_TO_CHECKOUT/code/`
* `env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o code.bin main.go` - need the linux/amd64 to run properly in gcp
* `docker login` if not already logged into docker hub
* `docker build -t kylesloan/automate-all-the-things:latest .`
* `docker tag automate-all-the-things:latest kylesloan/automate-all-the-things:latest` - TODO determine the user repo that they pushed to
* `docker push kylesloan/automate-all-the-things:latest`
* `cd $PATH_TO_CHECKOUT/k8/`
* `kubectl apply -f deploy.yml`
* `kubectl apply -f service.yml`
* `kubectl apply -f ingress.yml`
* `kubectl get ingress -o wide` - you can run this under watch and wait until you see the IP address appear, this took several minutes even after kubectl said it had assigned the ip to no longer get GCP error page
* `curl -iL $IP_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND`


## TODO

* Find lower level for the service account then owner to perform terraform actions
* monitoring/metrics/graphing
* ensure project name and ID exist so random blow ups are less frequent
* find way to get user's docker hub account, not in the file like other posts suggest: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
* mage should detect and download the proper binary when not used on macOS
* not a good way to determine what FROM docker bases were created in this process and what ones user already had on their system
* delete items pushes to docker hub
